    <h2>Spring</h2>
   <p>Spring is the season that comes between winter and summer,
     and it is marked by the return of warmer weather, longer days, and the growth of new plants. 
     According to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/spring-season" target="_blank">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>, 
     spring begins at the time of the vernal equinox, which usually happens around March 20 or 21 in the Northern Hemisphere.
      During this period the length of day and night is almost equal, and as the weeks go on the days become brighter and warmer. 
      This change in light and temperature brings trees back to life, flowers start to bloom, 
      and animals return to more active patterns. For people too, spring is often seen as a time of renewal, energy, 
      and fresh beginnings, reflecting the changes that happen in the natural world.</p>

    <h2>Summer</h2>
    <p>Summer is the warmest season of the year, falling between spring and autumn, 
        and it often brings the longest and brightest days. According to 
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/summer-season" target="_blank">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>, 
        summer in the Northern Hemisphere usually begins with the summer solstice around June 21 or 22 and
         ends with the autumnal equinox around September 22 or 23. During this time, the Earth tilts more 
         directly toward the sun, bathing the land in stronger sunlight, which warms the air and helps plants 
         grow more quickly and fully. For many people, summer is a time of growth and plenty, when festivals 
         celebrate harvests and communities enjoy the warm weather together. 
        It is a season that brings enerwidth="900" height="800">bloom.</p>

    <h2>Autumn</h2>
    <p>Autumn comes after summer and before winter, and it brings a gentle cooling of the air as the days
         gradually shorten. According to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/autumn-season" target="_blank">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>, 
         in the Northern Hemisphere autumn typically begins with the autumnal equinox around September 22 or 23 and 
         continues until the winter solstice in late December. During autumn, leaves change their colors and fall from trees,
          a transition that signals nature slowing down and preparing for winter. Many animals grow thicker fur, gather food,
           or migrate to escape the coming chill. Across cultures people celebrate the harvest
         and give thanks for crops, makwidth="900" height="800">uty and reflection.</p>

    <h2>Winter</h2>
<p>Winter follows autumn and comes before spring, and it is often the coldest time of the year. The name winter 
    comes from an old Germanic term meaning “time of water,” reflecting the rain and snow common in many regions,
     according to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/winter" target="_blank">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>. 
     In the Northern Hemisphere winter usually begins with the winter solstice around December 21 or 22 and lasts 
     until the vernal equinox in March. During this season many plants become dormant, some animals hibernate, 
     and insects die back, all conserving energy until warmer days return. 
    For people, winter often brings a quieter rhythm, holidays, and a sense of rest after autumn’s activity.</p>
